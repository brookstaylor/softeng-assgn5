# Answers:

## Question 1: 
  1. GME encourages me to go to events all over campus that I would not have known about if not for GME.
  2. Because it's an impetus to go to events and meet people I normally wouldn't.

## Question 2:
  1. We get an email from our Panhellenic officer every week.
  2. Weekly reports from KT.

## Question 3:
  1. Yes, we get the email every Monday morning so we know whatâ€™s happening during the week. 
  2. Yeah, also have anchorlink as a secondary source so don't think it's too hard to find events

## Question 4:
  1. Anchorlink.
  2. Anchorlink.

## Question 5:
  1. Yes, Anchorlink is easy to use. 
  2. Yeah pretty easy.

## Question 6:
  1. More faculty engagement opportunities would make it easier to complete GME. 
  2. Not having all the strict categories, just more of a go to x number of total events.

## Question 7:
  1. No, the weekly email and announcements are enough for me. 
  2. No, if I really wanna go I'll look it up.

## Question 8:
  1. Yes.
  2. Sure?

## Question 9:
  1. No, execs often remind us of big events and we also can always refer to the email for the full list. 
  2. I think time constraint is the only thing that prevents me from going to events.

## Question 10:
  1. More flexibility in which GME categories are required could improve things.
  2. Maybe a bulletin board in Rand that lists weekly events but really don't think it needs to change much.
