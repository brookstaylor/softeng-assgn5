# Answers:

## Question 1: 
  1. I care about GME because my chapter will get in trouble from the school if it is ignored.
  2. I would like to make sure that my house stay on campus and that we’re able to have events. I also would like to maintain the spirit of philanthropy amongst greek life. 

## Question 2:
  1. Through my fraternity and email.
  2. Chapter announcements.

## Question 3:
  1. Because my fraternity takes charge in making sure its members know what evens occur when.
  2. Easiest method without doing too much searching on a terrible system like AnchorLink

## Question 4:
  1. I am satisfied because I would not go to more events if I knew about them.
  2. No because it’s easy to forget a verbal announcement. AnchorLink is also not an ideal tool because its very cumbersome and oftentimes does not properly identify which events count for GME and which ones do not. 

## Question 5:
  1. I am frustrated by GME because I do not find it necessary or adding anything to my college experience.
  2. Yes. I am most frustrated by how inorganic it is. It is quite apparent at event that count for GME that people are not engaged and often just swipe into the event and then leave immediately after. I think if there was a better way to find GME events people are actually excited about it would help change this behavior.

## Question 6:
  1. I am satisfied using Anchorlink.
  2. No. I want to find event I am actually excited about and I want it to be clearly laid out, but currently things are very unorganized and oftentimes I just go to whatever events I find out about because I just try to get it over with.

## Question 7:
  1. It could be easier to finish GME if requirements were less stringent.
  2. Yes if we were more aware of when events were and how they fit in with our schedule.

## Question 8:
  1. That may help if I could sign up for texts regarding GME that interest me.
  2. Yes, it would be nice to be able to text a bot and it tell me the events and categories they fulfill during a specified time window

## Question 9:
  1. My favorite GME that I have been to are the events in the Wondry because I find them informative and useful.
  2. An event we had at the house today in support of one of my friends that recently beat cancer. It was a nice celebration with many friends and familiar faces.

## Question 10:
  1. Yes I have heard about events that seem interesting that I did not jnow about before.
  2. Yes always after the fact. I rarely hear about cool GME events before they happen. Oftentimes people will just have come back from an event that they thought was a lot of fun but I had no idea about.
