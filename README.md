# Answers:

## Question 1: 
  1. GME encourages me to go to events all over campus that I would not have known about if not for GME.
  2. Because it's an impetus to go to events and meet people I normally wouldn't.
  3. I care about GME because my chapter will get in trouble from the school if it is ignored.
  4. I would like to make sure that my house stay on campus and that we’re able to have events. I also would like to maintain the spirit of philanthropy amongst greek life. 

## Question 2:
  1. We get an email from our Panhellenic officer every week.
  2. Weekly reports from KT.
  3. Through my fraternity and email.
  4. Chapter announcements.

## Question 3:
  1. Yes, we get the email every Monday morning so we know what’s happening during the week. 
  2. Yeah, also have anchorlink as a secondary source so don't think it's too hard to find events
  3. Because my fraternity takes charge in making sure its members know what evens occur when.
  4. Easiest method without doing too much searching on a terrible system like AnchorLink

## Question 4:
  1. Anchorlink.
  2. Anchorlink.
  3. I am satisfied because I would not go to more events if I knew about them.
  4. No because it’s easy to forget a verbal announcement. AnchorLink is also not an ideal tool because its very cumbersome and oftentimes does not properly identify which events count for GME and which ones do not. 

## Question 5:
  1. Yes, Anchorlink is easy to use. 
  2. Yeah pretty easy.
  3. I am frustrated by GME because I do not find it necessary or adding anything to my college experience.
  4. Yes. I am most frustrated by how inorganic it is. It is quite apparent at event that count for GME that people are not engaged and often just swipe into the event and then leave immediately after. I think if there was a better way to find GME events people are actually excited about it would help change this behavior.

## Question 6:
  1. More faculty engagement opportunities would make it easier to complete GME. 
  2. Not having all the strict categories, just more of a go to x number of total events.
  3. I am frustrated by GME because I do not find it necessary or adding anything to my college experience.
  4. No. I want to find event I am actually excited about and I want it to be clearly laid out, but currently things are very unorganized and oftentimes I just go to whatever events I find out about because I just try to get it over with.

## Question 7:
  1. No, the weekly email and announcements are enough for me. 
  2. No, if I really wanna go I'll look it up.
  3. It could be easier to finish GME if requirements were less stringent.
  4. Yes if we were more aware of when events were and how they fit in with our schedule.

## Question 8:
  1. Yes.
  2. Sure?
  3. That may help if I could sign up for texts regarding GME that interest me.

## Question 9:
  1. No, execs often remind us of big events and we also can always refer to the email for the full list. 
  2. I think time constraint is the only thing that prevents me from going to events.
  3. My favorite GME that I have been to are the events in the Wondry because I find them informative and useful.

## Question 10:
  1. More flexibility in which GME categories are required could improve things.
  2. Maybe a bulletin board in Rand that lists weekly events but really don't think it needs to change much.
  3. Yes I have heard about events that seem interesting that I did not jnow about before.
